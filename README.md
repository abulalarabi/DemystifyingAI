# DemystifyingAI
Machine learning is currently like a black box. It is difficult to understand what and how the models learn. The central objective is to facilitate user empowerment by furnishing them with visual representations of machine-learning models and how different features contribute to the learned model via an intuitively accessible interface. This will, in turn, equip users with the capacity to delve into, comprehend, and deliberate upon the predictions generated by artificial intelligence models, thus enabling them to make well-informed decisions. The overarching goal is to serve as a conduit between the realm of artificial intelligence technology and its tangible utility, thereby fostering an ethos of transparency.

### Installation Manual for Python Backend

---

#### Overview

This manual guides you through setting up a Python web application utilizing Flask for web functionalities and various machine learning libraries for data processing and analysis.

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

#### Dependencies

- Flask
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Flask-CORS
- Plotly
- SHAP
- ExplainerDashboard

---

#### Installation Steps

**1. Environment Setup**

   - Create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On Unix or MacOS:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

**2. Install Required Libraries**

   - Install all the required Python libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install Flask pandas scikit-learn Flask-CORS plotly shap explainerdashboard
     ```

**3. Running the Application**

   - Navigate to the project directory/backend and run the Flask app:
     ```bash
     python backend.py
     ```
   - The Flask application should start and be accessible via `http://localhost:1407` or the configured port.
